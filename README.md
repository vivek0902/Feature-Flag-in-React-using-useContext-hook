# Feature Flag in React using useContext Hook

Live Demo: [https://vivek0902.github.io/Feature-Flag-in-React-using-useContext-hook/](https://vivek0902.github.io/Feature-Flag-in-React-using-useContext-hook/)

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to implement feature flags in a React application using the `useContext` hook. Feature flags allow for selective feature toggling based on user types, such as "free" and "premium" users.

## Features

- Feature flag management using React Context API
- Toggle features dynamically based on user type
- Example features include:
  - Dark Mode
  - Chat
  - Audio Chat
  - Video Chat
- Simple UI with toggle switches

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

### Steps

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/feature-flag-react.git
   cd feature-flag-react
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
   or
   ```sh
   yarn install
   ```
3. Start the development server:
   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```
   or
   ```sh
   yarn dev
   ```
4. Open `http://localhost:5173` in your browser (if using Vite).

## How It Works

- `FeaturesFlagProvider.jsx`: Provides the feature flag context.
- `Feature.jsx`: Checks if a feature is enabled for the current user type.
- Users can switch between "Free" and "Premium" plans to see different features enabled or disabled.

## Feature Flags Use Cases

Feature flags, also known as feature toggles, are a software development technique that allows developers to enable or disable features at runtime without deploying new code, offering flexibility and control over releases and user experiences. Below are some common use cases:

### 1. **Testing in Production**

- **A/B Testing**:  
  Feature flags enable A/B testing, allowing you to compare different versions of a feature to see which performs better with real users.
- **Canary Releases**:  
  You can gradually roll out new features to a small subset of users (the "canary" group) before releasing them to everyone, allowing for early detection of potential issues.

- **Testing Refactorings**:  
  Feature flags can be used to test refactorings in production, ensuring that the intended result is not impacted by the refactor.

### 2. **Managing Releases and Rollbacks**

- **Quicker Release Cycles**:  
  Feature flags enable faster release cycles by allowing you to deploy code changes without immediately exposing new features to all users.

- **Rollback/Kill Switch**:  
  If a new feature causes problems, you can quickly disable it by toggling the corresponding flag, without needing to roll back the entire release.

- **Continuous Deployment**:  
  Feature flags facilitate continuous deployment by allowing you to deploy code changes frequently while controlling feature visibility.

### 3. **Targeted Features and User Experience**

- **Feature Gating**:  
  You can use feature flags to control which features are visible to different user groups or based on their roles or permissions.
- **Beta Programs**:  
  Feature flags can be used to manage beta programs, allowing you to give early access to a new feature to a select group of users.

- **Customized User Experiences**:  
  You can use feature flags to personalize the user experience by showing different features or content to different users based on their preferences or behavior.

- **Restricting or Enabling Certain User Roles and Permissions**:  
  Feature flags can be used to grant or revoke specific permissions for certain user groups or structure permission levels.

## Usage Example

```jsx
<FeaturesFlagProvider userType={userType}>
  <Feature name="darkMode">
    <label className="toggle-switch">
      <input type="checkbox" />
      <span className="slider"></span>
    </label>
  </Feature>
</FeaturesFlagProvider>
```

In the above example, we wrap the feature components inside the `FeaturesFlagProvider` and pass in the `userType` (either "free" or "premium") as a prop. Inside the `Feature` component, we check if a specific feature, like `darkMode`, is enabled for the user.
